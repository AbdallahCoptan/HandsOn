Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud (Amazon EC2) provides scalable computing capacity in the Amazon Web Services (AWS) cloud. Using Amazon EC2 eliminates your need to invest in hardware up front, so you can develop and deploy applications faster. You can use Amazon EC2 to launch as many or as few virtual servers as you need, configure security and networking, and manage storage. Amazon EC2 enables you to scale up or down to handle changes in requirements or spikes in popularity, reducing your need to forecast traffic. If you would like to know more about Cloud Computing from AWS point of view, see What is Cloud Computing? How to get started with Amazon EC2 First, you need to get set up to use Amazon EC2. After you are set up, you are ready to complete the Getting Started tutorial for Amazon EC2. Whenever you need more information about an Amazon EC2 feature, you can read the technical documentation. You need to get familiar with the follwoing: Instances and AMIs Regions and Availability Zones Instance types Tags Setting up with Amazon EC2 Complete the tasks in this section to get set up for launching an Amazon EC2 instance for the first time: Sign up for AWS Create a key pair Create a security group Sign up for AWS Please follow the instructions in Setting Up an AWS Account . Create a key pair AWS uses public-key cryptography to secure the login information for your instance. A Linux instance has no password; you use a key pair to log in to your instance securely. You specify the name of the key pair when you launch your instance, then provide the private key when you log in using SSH. If you haven't created a key pair already, you can create one using the Amazon EC2 console. Note that if you plan to launch instances in multiple Regions, you'll need to create a key pair in each Region. For more information about Regions, see Regions, Availability Zones, and Local Zones . You can create a key pair using one of the following method: Open the Amazon EC2 console at https://console.aws.amazon.com/ec2/ . In the navigation pane, choose Key Pairs . Choose Create key pair . For Name , enter a descriptive name for the key pair. Amazon EC2 associates the public key with the name that you specify as the key name. A key name can include up to 255 ASCII characters. It can\u2019t include leading or trailing spaces. For File format, choose the format in which to save the private key. To save the private key in a format that can be used with OpenSSH, choose pem . To save the private key in a format that can be used with PuTTY, choose ppk . Choose Create key pair . The private key file is automatically downloaded by your browser. The base file name is the name you specified as the name of your key pair, and the file name extension is determined by the file format you chose. Save the private key file in a safe place. /!\\ Important This is the only chance for you to save the private key file.{: .note} If you will use an SSH client on a macOS or Linux computer to connect to your Linux instance, use the following command to set the permissions of your private key file so that only you can read it. chmod 400 my-key-pair.pem If you do not set these permissions, then you cannot connect to your instance using this key pair.
