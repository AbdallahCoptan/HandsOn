#  The most popular and fastest cloud data warehouse: Amazon Redshift

[Amazon Redshift](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/redshift/latest/mgmt/welcome.html) is a fully managed, petabyte-scale data warehouse service in the cloud. You can start with just a few hundred gigabytes of data and scale to a petabyte or more. This enables you to use your data to acquire new insights for your business and customers. 

Check, [Amazon Redshift pricing](https://aws.amazon.com/redshift/pricing/) before starting the warehouse development on AWS Redshift.

## Redshift Use Cases

1.  Business intelligence

Redshift makes it simple and cost effective to run high performance queries on petabytes of structured data so that you can build powerful reports and dashboards using your existing business intelligence tools.

2.  Operational analytics on business events

Bring together structured data from your data warehouse and semi-structured data such as application logs from your S3 data lake to get real-time operational insights on your applications and systems.


### Cluster management

An Amazon Redshift cluster is a set of nodes, which consists of a leader node and one or more compute nodes. The type and number of compute nodes that you need depends on the size of your data, the number of queries you will execute, and the query execution performance that you need.

### Creating and managing clusters

Depending on your data warehousing needs, you can start with a small, single-node cluster and easily scale up to a larger, multi-node cluster as your requirements change. You can add or remove compute nodes to the cluster without any interruption to the service. For more information, see [Amazon Redshift clusters](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/redshift/latest/mgmt/working-with-clusters.html).
