# Setting Up an AWS Account

## Create your account

In order to sign up to AWS services, please follow the following steps:

1. Open the [Amazon Web Services](https://aws.amazon.com/) home page.

2. Choose Create an AWS Account.
Note: If you signed in to AWS recently, choose Sign in to the Console. If Create a new AWS account isn't visible, first choose Sign in to a different account, and then choose Create a new AWS account.

3. Enter your account information, and then choose Continue. Be sure that you enter your account information correctly, especially your email address. If you enter your email address incorrectly, you can't access your account.

4. Choose Personal or Professional.
Note: Personal accounts and professional accounts have the same features and functions.
    
5. Enter your company or personal information.
Important: For professional AWS accounts, it's a best practice to enter the company phone number rather than a personal cell phone. Configuring a root account with an individual email address or a personal phone number can make your account insecure.
    
6. Read and accept the AWS Customer Agreement.
Note: Be sure that you read and understand the terms of the AWS Customer Agreement.
    
7. Choose Create Account and Continue.


 You receive an email to confirm that your account is created. You can sign in to your new account using the email address and password you registered with. However, you can't use AWS services until you finish activating your account.

## Add a Payment Method

On the Payment Information page, enter the information about your payment method, and then choose Verify and Add.

**Note:** If you want to use a different billing address for your AWS billing information, choose Use a new address before you choose Verify and Add.

Important: You cannot proceed with the sign-up process until you add a valid payment method.
