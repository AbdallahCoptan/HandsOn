The **objective** of this tutorial is to offer a set of **practical sessions** around selected tools we consider relevant for the many challenges opened by _Reproducible Research_:

* Accurate, organized and _easy-to\{read|take|share\} Docs_
    - [ Markdown](https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown/), [mkdocs](http://www.mkdocs.org/), [org-mode](http://doc.norang.ca/org-mode.html), [Read the Docs](https://readthedocs.org/)...
* _Sharing Code and Data_
    - [`git`](https://git-scm.com/), [Github](https://github.com/), [Bitbucket](https://bitbucket.org/), [Gitlab](https://about.gitlab.com/)...
* _Mastering your environment clean and automated_ by:
    - Using common building tools \hfill{make, cmake etc.}
    - Using a constrained environment
          * Sandboxed Ruby/Python,[Vagrant](https://www.vagrantup.com), [Docker](https://www.docker.com/)
    - Automate its building through cross-platform recipes
    - Automatically test your recipes for Environment configuration

The hands-on are listed on [this page](hands-on/).
