# Other AWS Compute Services



Building and running your application starts with compute, whether you are building enterprise, cloud-native, or mobile applications; or running massive clusters to sequence the human genome.

AWS offers a comprehensive portfolio of compute services that allow you to develop, deploy, run, and scale your applications and workloads in the worldâ€™s most powerful, secure, and innovative compute cloud.



**Details about the full range of AWS compute services can be found [here](https://aws.amazon.com/products/compute/)** .



Two other styles of computing may Hyddrosat is interested on them :

1. [serverless computing](#aws-lambda)
2. [container services](#aws-container-services)



## AWS Lambda


AWS Lambda lets you run code without provisioning or managing servers. You pay only for the compute time you consume--there is no charge when your code isn't running. Additional information about Lambda can be found at: [https://aws.amazon.com/lambda](https://aws.amazon.com/lambda)

## AWS Container Services

Please check the [Containers on AWS](https://aws.amazon.com/containers/), The most secure, reliable, and scalable way to run containers 


### 1. AWS ECS

Amazon Elastic Container Service (Amazon ECS) is a highly scalable, high-performance container orchestration service that supports Docker containers. It allows you to run and scale containerized applications on AWS. You can find more details at: [https://aws.amazon.com/ecs/](https://aws.amazon.com/ecs/)

### 2. Amazon EKS


Amazon Elastic Container Service for Kubernetes (Amazon EKS) makes it straightforward to deploy, manage, and scale containerized applications that use Kubernetes on AWS. Details can be found at:[https://aws.amazon.com/eks/](https://aws.amazon.com/eks/)
