# Amazon S3 Object Storage 

Amazon Simple Storage Service (Amazon S3) stores data as objects within resources that are called buckets. You can store as many objects as you want within a bucket, and you can write, read, and delete objects in your bucket. Objects can be up to 5 TB in size.

You can control access to both the bucket and the objects (who can create, delete, and retrieve objects in the bucket for example), and view access logs for the bucket and its objects. You can also choose the AWS Region where a bucket is stored to optimize for latency, minimize costs, or address regulatory requirements. 

With Amazon S3, you pay only for what you use. There is no minimum fee. Estimate your monthly bill by using the [AWS Simple Monthly](https://calculator.s3.amazonaws.com/index.html) Calculator. We charge less where our costs are less, and prices are based on the location of your Amazon S3 bucket.

## S3 Benefits

- Industry-leading performance, scalability, availability, and durability
- Wide range of cost-effective storage classes
- Unmatched security, compliance, and audit capabilities
- Easily manage data and access controls
- Query-in-place services for analytics 
-  Most supported cloud storage service


## Block-storage(EBS, EFS) vs. S3 Storage

Finally, Amazon S3 is an object store good at storing vast numbers of backups or user files. Unlike EBS or EFS, S3 is not limited to EC2. Files stored within an [S3 bucket](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/UsingBucket.html) can be accessed programmatically or directly from services such as AWS CloudFront. This is why many websites use it to hold their content and media files, which may be served efficiently from AWS CloudFront.



### Amazon S3 Use Cases

1. Data lake and big data analytics
2. Backup and restoration
3. Reliable disaster recovery
4. Methodical archiving



## Amazon S3 Demonstration


Let's go ahead and create a bucket, and actually upload an object into that bucket. See [Working with Amazon S3 Buckets](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/UsingBucket.html), and do:

1. Naviage to the aws console,
2. Look for the S3 services,
3. Select **Create Bucket**,
	
	a. give it a name

	b. select an aws region

	c. leave the rest as default

4. Add data (files, images, or videos) to the created bucket

	a. Upload an object

	b. Set object properties

	c. Set object permissions

5. **Delete** your data, by checking the bucket and click **delete**
